# Product-Matching-with-Text-Similarity
Product matching refers to the task of finding the same or similar products against a target list of known products. This has multiple applications in retail and CPG, from price benchmarking, range rationalization, general competitor intelligence, and recommendation engines.
Product matching in itself is a sub-application of the wider NLP (natural language processing) field of text matching. Hence, the approach/methods developed in the context of product matching should have a wide range of applications.
The Primary objective of this experiment is to deploy advanced NLP techniques to identify similar products in a retail dataset. To accomplish this, we will consider multiple text fields and product metadata to find the similarity score.
Further, we will explore multiple approaches to visualize/inspect text data and build scalable similarity scoring methods.
